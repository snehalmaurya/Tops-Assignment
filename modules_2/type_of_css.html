→There are main Three type of CSS are as follow

→ Inline CSS:Inline CSS is used to style a specific HTML element. Add a style attribute to each HTML tag without using the selectors. Managing a website may be difficult if we use only inline CSS. However, Inline CSS in HTML is useful in some situations. We have not accessed the CSS files or to apply styles to elements.

→Internal CSS:The Internal CSS has <style> tag in the <head> section of the HTML document. This CSS style is an effective way to style single pages. Using the CSS style for multiple web pages is time-consuming because we require placing the style on each web page.

→External CSS:In external CSS, we link the web pages to the external .css file. It is created by a text editor. The CSS is a more efficient method for styling a website. By editing the .css file, we can change the whole site at once.
